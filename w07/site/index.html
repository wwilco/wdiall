            I am an entry-level programmer who is looking to further their knowledge of web design. I have experience in Javascript, Node, HTML5, and CSS3.
            </br>I have held a variety of different jobs but from each one I have learned a great deal.
            I have had experience working with two non-profit organizations. First as a fundraiser for the United Nations Refugee Agency. I began as a canvasser and eventually became a data and statistics analyst. I tracked the progress of individual fundraisers as well as the growth of donations the UNHCR received in New York. While this was only a very small portion of the UNHCR's annual donations, this research was used to improve other fundraising teams around the country.
            With the Working Families Party, during the 2012 election season, I did public outreach and organized projects. I oversaw groups of fundraisers and canvassers and provided them with the proper training to inform the public.
            </br>I helped open The Nomad Hotel. Interested in doing work in hospitality, I oversaw private events. I am currently working as a server at Lighthouse, a restaurant in Brooklyn that is dedicated to local food and sustainability. Working in a restaurant has been a challenge and it has helped me develop many personal skills. This led to working with Waste No More, an alternative waste management organization that works with local composting projects in north Brooklyn.
            </br>I earned my BA from Saint Michael's College in Burlington, VT. While in Vermont I was very active in the local music industry. I was an event planner for Turtle Unground Music Hall, columnist and reviewer for Big Heavy World Music, and radio host for 88.7 The Mic. My involvement in these programs was both artistic and business oriented. Finance management was a key component of Turtle Underground, and promotional artwork, web design and social networking were key elements while working at Big Heavy World Music.
            I am a musician and have played in several bands, most notably, Slander and Jungles.
            </br>I have a strong work ethic and will be a strong addition to any organization that wishes to use my services.
